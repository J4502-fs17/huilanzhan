      <p>A small study using Photovoice to let sexual assault survivors reclaim their own stories through photography shows promise for recovery from post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>

      <p> Photovoice, a process where people present their photos and share their stories through conversations, can help sexual assault survivors recover from PTSD, Abigail Rolbiecki found from her research. Rolbiecki, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Missouri’s School of Medicine, has worked for MU’s Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention Center on campus for three years and later conducted the study with three other researchers.</p>

      <p>The study, “‘Waiting for the Cold to End’: Using Photovoice as a Narrative Intervention for Survivors of Sexual Assault,” was published in August in the journal Traumatology, the Columbia Missourian reported.. </p>

      <p>An interaction between a mentally ill or distraught person and a police officer can, and does, sometimes end badly.</p>

      <p>In July 2008, a man threatening to take his life fell off a pedestrian walkway over I-70 after Columbia police shot him with a Taser. He broke his jaw, arms and a bone in his face.</p>

      <p>A Columbia Police Department investigation concluded that the use of the Taser in the incident was justified, but the city eventually paid $300,000 to settle a lawsuit with the man.</p>

      <p>In the years since, local law enforcement agencies have stepped up their training to improve officers' ability to deal with people in a mental health crisis. That training has been delivered through the work of the Mid-Missouri Crisis Intervention Team Council — the most recent in mid-November at the Boone County Sheriff's Department Annex.</p>

  <h2>Hidden street poems are ready for readings in the rain</h2>

      <p>If you don't usually go walking in the rain, you might want to make an exception.</p>

      <p>Sidewalks in downtown Columbia have been decorated with hidden poetry, and, because the poems are painted on walkways with a clear water repellent spray, the words are only visible when the sidewalk gets wet.</p>

      <p>The hidden poems, aptly called "raining poetry," were placed by staff members at The Missouri Review, a literary magazine, in an effort to remind people of the purpose of the magazine and encourage enthusiasm for literature. In all, there are nine poems spray-painted around Columbia. The locations of the hidden poetry sites will be revealed, starting Thursday, through a live streaming event on The District's Facebook page.</p>

      <p>The Nigerian terror group Boko Haram may be best known for kidnapping 276 schoolgirls in 2014, a move that spurred the #BringBackOurGirls social media campaign.</p>

      <p>Less well known is the fact that the group’s bombings, shootings and kidnappings have triggered a humanitarian crisis in northern Nigeria – one that has spilled over into neighboring Cameroon’s Far North region. In total, an estimated 2.2 million people have been forced from their homes since 2014 – including tens of thousands of refugees who have fled across the border to Cameroon.</p>
